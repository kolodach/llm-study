## Study Plan

### Week 1: NLP Fundamentals and Python Programming

Study the basics of NLP, including text preprocessing, tokenization, and stemming.
Learn Python programming and practice manipulating text data using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
Problem-solving exercise: Implement a text classification model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

### Week 2: Deep Learning Foundations

Understand the basics of neural networks, including feedforward networks and backpropagation.
Implement a simple feedforward neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Problem-solving exercise: Build a sentiment analysis model using a feedforward neural network to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Week 3: Sequence Modeling

Dive deeper into sequence modeling techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTMs.
Implement an RNN or LSTM model to generate text character by character.
Problem-solving exercise: Train an LSTM language model on a text corpus and generate new text samples.

### Week 4: Language Modeling

Explore language modeling architectures such as RNNLMs and Transformer-based models.
Study techniques like masked language modeling and autoregressive decoding.
